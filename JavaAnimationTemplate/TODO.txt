Drawable
	- instantiated with the business object
	- draw
	- handle mouse events / interactive events / or propagate them
	
Example of drawable - CompositeDrawable
	- lists a set of drawable
	- can switch which drawable actually drawn

Refreshable
	- contains base executor code
	- has refresh, stop and start, this is a timer that changes the internal logic of the drawable

AnimatedPanel
	- manages layers
		- add layer
		- addToLayer( layerNumber, Drawable)
		- set FPS, this is the fps for redrawing to the back buffer

AnimationController
		- can stop/start individual drawables
		- can show/hide individual layers

EventPropagator/NullEventPropagator - a controls listener
		- propagateMouseEvents
		
		
This helps me manage animations in java only.
